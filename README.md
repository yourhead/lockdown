## From the LogHound site

Automatically create a SiteMap of your web page and so much more.

### Features

 - Create a *siteindex.xml* file for to help google index better.
 - Ensure your web page doesn't have default titles and filenames (such as "Untitled Page 3" or "page4/pag36.html"). 
 - Easily turn off web crawling for a given page within your site.
 - SiteMap will create SiteMaps in a variety of styles (including blog entires!)




### Quick Start

The easiest way to use Sitemap is to simply download a copy and try it. The free download has all of the features (only you can't save until you register) By just inserting a Sitemap page you can instantly get a nice tree view of your website. 

Of course you may prefer some other view which you can select here as well as choose to include descriptions or not (more on this later) 
 

You may want to dress it up a bit.... for instance it's possible some pages on your site have default Titles, filenames or Foldernames -- Not at all pretty! Go to the site organization pane and click the "Show pages with defaults..." to see a suggestion of pages to clean up before publishing a SiteMap. 

While you are here type in a description for each page to help annotate the sitemap AND give the search engines a better idea of what your page is about. 
 


### Blogs

Of course if you have a blog Sitemap supports automatic insertion of your blogs & archives (Archive feature only available with Built In Blog)

Simply tell Sitemap if you want them enabled or not and how many posts to include.
